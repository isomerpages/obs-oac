<h3><strong>Information on Singapore Standard for OAE Activities (SS OAEA)</strong></h3>
<p>The SS OAEA, owned by Enterprise Singapore (<a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/Grow-Your-Business/boost-capabilities/quality-and-standards/comment-on-draft-standards" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ESG</a>),
is co-convened by Outward Bound Singapore (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov.sg/en/obs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OBS</a>) and the Outdoor Learning
and Adventure Education (<a href="https://www.olae.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OLAE</a>) Association. It aims to enhance the
quality and safety of Outdoor Adventure Education activities in Singapore.
It encompasses land-based, water-based, and height activities, and is contextualised
to include indoor conduct due to Singapore's urbanised environment and
tropical climate.</p>
<p>By setting a national standard for the Operations, Training and Certification
of OAE providers, the objective is to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ensure safe management, maintenance, and operation of OAE sites and equipment
by facility operators and activity providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish training and certification requirements for OAE practitioners
to ensure safe and proficient conduct of activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set minimum standards for evaluations, insurance criteria, and professional
development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a resource for properly trained OAE professionals in operations
and training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a reference for certification, accreditation, and conformity
assessment of OAE providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide government and regulatory agencies in drafting regulations and potential
adoption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These objectives aim to professionalise the OAE sector (providers and
practitioners), minimise the number of incidents arising from the use of
OAE activities and support the continued growth of OAE activities in educational
programmes.</p>
