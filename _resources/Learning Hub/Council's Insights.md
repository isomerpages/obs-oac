<h4>Professional Development Research Study</h4>
<p>The Council is commissioning a research study, focusing on three key areas
within the sector.</p>
<p>At the <strong>macro level, </strong>the analysis aims to determine the
sector's growth potential for businesses. It will also look at the job
perception of OAE professionals from both job seekers' and employers' perspectives,
and study the industry's demand for professionals.</p>
<p>In terms of <strong>career progression and development</strong>, the study
aims to identify and enhance the careers of OAE professionals. It will
establish training and development pathways aligned with validated competency
maps. It will devise strategies to attract and retain professionals in
the industry, and uncover transferable roles in parallel industries.</p>
<p>Lastly, the study will look into <strong>salary and remuneration.</strong> It
will compare the salaries of full-time and freelance OAE professionals
to those in similar local sectors. It will also propose a competency-based
salary structure, and assess the feasibility and effects of a progressive
wage model for the sector.</p>
<p>Overall, this comprehensive research study aims to provide valuable insights
and recommendations to support the growth, development, and sustainability
of the OAE sector, ensuring a thriving and rewarding career path for professionals
in the field.</p>
