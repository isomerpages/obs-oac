<h3>What is Accreditation?</h3>
<p>Accreditation serves as a seal of approval, assuring all stakeholders
that the activities are conducted with safety, quality, and excellence
at the forefront. It signifies that providers and practitioners meet certain
standards, establishing trust in the experience they offer. This process
is critical for sectoral improvement and growth.</p>
<p>The OAE Council is developing the Singapore Standards for OAE Activities.
This is the foundation of future national certification and accreditation
scheme. You can expect some developments on local accreditation from 2025
onwards.</p>
<h3>Why should my organisation undergo accreditation?</h3>
<p>Undergoing an operations review and/or accreditation of your operations
is a good way of improving your OAE activity safety and quality system.</p>
