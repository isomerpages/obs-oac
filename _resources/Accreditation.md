<h3>Why should my organisation undergo accreditation?</h3>
<p>Accreditation serves as a seal of approval, assuring all stakeholders
that the activities are conducted with safety, quality, and excellence
at the forefront. It signifies that providers and practitioners meet certain
standards, establishing trust in the experience they offer. This process
is critical for sectoral improvement and growth.</p>
<p>Undergoing an operations review and/or accreditation of your operations
is a good way of improving your OAE activity safety and quality system.
The OAE Council is developing the Singapore Standards for OAE Activities,
which will form the foundation of a future national certification and accreditation
scheme. Anticipate developments on local accreditation scheme from 2025
onwards.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of accredited providers of various activities who
