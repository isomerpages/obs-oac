<h3><strong>Accreditation is the way forward</strong></h3>
<p>Accreditation serves as a seal of approval. It assures stakeholders that
the activities are safe, of high-quality and excellent. It shows that providers
and practitioners meet certain standards, establishing trust in the experiences

which will form the basis of a future national certification and accreditation
scheme. Anticipate developments on local accreditation scheme from 2025
