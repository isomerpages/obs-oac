</p>
<p>In Singapore, intensifying bad weather events pose significant challenges
for outdoor adventure education (OAE) programmes, necessitating robust
safety measures to mitigate risks such as heavy rain, strong winds, and
flash floods.</p>
<p>OAE providers are advised to regularly review risk management plans, monitor
weather forecasts through NEA platforms, and establish clear criteria for
adjusting or halting activities during adverse weather. Additionally, they
must ensure participants are fit for the activities, stay informed of relevant
advisories, and have a well-prepared Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place.</p>
<p>Specific environments—such as open water bodies, forests, and campgrounds—require
tailored safety measures. Providers should plan for rapid response to adverse
conditions, monitor environmental indicators, and inspect adventure structures
after weather events to ensure continued safety.</p>
<p>Download the advisory (above) for more information.</p>
