</p>
<p>Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events globally, including
in Southeast Asia, where stronger monsoons, storms, and Sumatra squalls
are becoming more frequent. In Singapore, these conditions pose challenges
for outdoor adventure education (OAE) programmes, necessitating robust
safety measures to mitigate risks like heavy rain, strong winds, and flash
floods.</p>
<p>OAE providers should review risk management plans, monitor weather forecasts
through NEA platforms, and establish clear criteria for adjusting or halting
activities during adverse weather. Additionally, they must ensure participant
fitness, stay informed of advisories, and have a well-prepared Emergency
Action Plan (EAP) in place.</p>
<p>Specific environments, such as open water bodies, forests, and campgrounds,
require tailored safety measures. Providers should plan for rapid response
to adverse conditions, monitor environmental indicators, and inspect adventure
structures after weather events to ensure continued safety.</p>
