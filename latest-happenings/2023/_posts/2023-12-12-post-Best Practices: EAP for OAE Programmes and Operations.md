<blockquote><p>This document provides guidance to Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE) programme providers on developing a robust Emergency Action Plan (EAP). It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the well-being of participants and offers good practices to enhance existing EAPs or create new ones. Collaboration with site owners and client organisers is encouraged to develop a comprehensive and mutually agreed-upon plan.</p><p></p><p>Providers are encouraged to thoroughly review the document and incorporate its recommendations into their overall crisis management plan, addressing any identified gaps. To facilitate this process, an organizational review worksheet is included at the end of the document. This worksheet serves as a self-assessment tool for providers to evaluate their current emergency response capabilities and make necessary improvements.</p></blockquote><p><a href="/files/OAE_EAP_Practices_Jan_24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Download Best Practices: EAP for OAE Programmes and Operations</a></p>
