# **Building trust and confidence in the OAE sector**

The strengthening of the OAE sector will take time, and the OAE Council will lead the development by:
#### 1. Establishing national standards for operations and safety: 
The Council will oversee the development of national standards and technical references for Singapore’s OAE sector. These will guide specifications for the design and conduct of OAE activities, including the installation, operation, and maintenance of OAE facilities, infrastructure, and equipment. Over time, the Council will recommend core competencies and professional certifications required for local OAE instructors. Through the adoption of the national standards, the public can be assured of transparent, consistent, and safe OAE practices across the sector.
#### 2. Developing professional development roadmap:
The Council will engage with OAE stakeholders to understand the sector’s challenges and develop strategies on professionalising and recognising OAE practitioners. The Council will also consult relevant government agencies and stakeholders, and recommend support measures and initiatives to help the sustainable growth of the sector.
