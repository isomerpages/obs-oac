Reporting to the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), the 19-member OAE Council is an advisory body comprising government agencies, private sector providers, outdoor practitioners and relevant experts from academia, industrial safety and professional development.

# National OAE Masterplan
The National OAE Masterplan was announced during Budget and COS 2016 to promote holistic development for all youths through a OAE pathway from primary to post-secondary school level. The Masterplan was put on hold over most of 2020-2021 due to Covid-19. The lifting of vaccination differentiated measures after 1Q 2022 has allowed schools to progressively resume cohort camps and other OAE activities.
