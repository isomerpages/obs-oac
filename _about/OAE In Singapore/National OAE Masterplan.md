<h3>Why OAE is unique in Singaporeâ€™s context</h3>
<p>The National OAE Masterplan estimates that 218,000 students participate
in OAE programmes and adventure pursuits annually. The MOE Outdoor Adventure
Learning Centres and Outward Bound Singapore support 90,000 students through
various camps and programmes. About 40 commercial OAE providers support
an additional 128,000 students. They also cater to numerous youths and
adults engaged in recreational adventure activities.</p>

<p>The National OAE Masterplan was announced during Budget and COS 2016 to
promote holistic development for all youths through a OAE pathway from
primary to post-secondary school level. All primary and secondary school
students are equipped with outdoor living skills, knowledge and attitude
through the OE in Physical Education (PE) Curriculum introduced in 2014.
They are provided with authentic outdoor environments through 2 to 3 school
cohort camps at upper primary and secondary levels.</p>
<p>On 23 February 2024, MOE announced the consolidation of eight OAE sites
to four locations, which will allow schools to conduct upper primary and
lower secondary cohort camps at these sites. Together, these four locations
are projected to fully meet the camping needs of some 100,000 students
participating in cohort camps and uniformed group programmes each year,
from 2032 onwards.</p>
