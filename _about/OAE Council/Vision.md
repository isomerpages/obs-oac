<h3><strong>Vision for our OAE Sector</strong></h3>
<p>The OAE Council has identified two long-term outcomes for the OAE Sector:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A <strong>self-regulated</strong> sector that is <strong>highly responsible</strong> in
ensuring safe practices while being <strong>accountable</strong> to themselves,
the sector and the consumers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>thriving sector</strong> that strives to be <strong>exemplary</strong> in
professionalism, continuous development, and designing and delivering quality
OAE programmes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This vision can be achieved through the commitment of all OAE stakeholders
and OAE Council in areas of trust-building, knowledge-sharing and collective
responsibility of uplifting the sector.</p>
