<h3>Why OAE is unique in Singaporeâ€™s context</h3><p>The National OAE Masterplan estimates that 218,000 students participate in OAE programmes and adventure pursuits annually. The MOE Outdoor Adventure Learning Centres and Outward Bound Singapore support 90,000 students through various camps and programmes. About 40 commercial OAE providers support an additional 128,000 students. They also cater to numerous youths and adults engaged in recreational adventure activities.</p><h3>National OAE Masterplan</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/NOAE_MP.png"></div><p>The National OAE Masterplan was announced during Budget and COS 2016 to promote holistic development for all youths through a OAE pathway from primary to post-secondary school level. All primary and secondary school students are equipped with outdoor living skills, knowledge and attitude through the OE in Physical Education (PE) Curriculum introduced in 2014. They are provided with authentic outdoor environments through 2 to 3 school cohort camps at upper primary and secondary levels.</p><p>The Masterplan was put on hold over most of 2020-2021 due to Covid-19. The lifting of vaccination differentiated measures after 1Q 2022 has allowed schools to progressively resume cohort camps and other OAE activities.</p>
