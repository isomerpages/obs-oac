## Future of OAE Sector

The OAE Council has identified two long-term outcomes for the OAE Sector: 

* A **self-regulated** sector that is **highly responsible** in ensuring safe practices while being **accountable** to themselves, the sector and the consumers; and
* A **thriving sector** that strives to be **exemplary** in professionalism, continuous development, and designing and delivering quality OAE programmes.
