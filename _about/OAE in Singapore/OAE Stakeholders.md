<h3><strong>The OAE Sector is Connected</strong></h3>
<p>The OAE ecosystem is deeply interconnected and intertwined, with various
stakeholders playing crucial roles. The sector's success relies on strengthening
symbiotic relationships and fostering a shared vision of delivering safe
and high-quality outdoor programs for participants. Collaboration and alignment
among all involved parties are essential for the thriving and sustainable
growth of the OAE sector.</p>
