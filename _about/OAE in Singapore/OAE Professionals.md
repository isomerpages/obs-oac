<h3><strong>We are OAE Professionals</strong></h3>
<p>The role of an OAE professional, particularly an educator, involves utilising
the outdoors as a platform for self-discovery and social awareness. They
play a critical role in the holistic development of Singaporean youth.
Through carefully designed activities, OAE professionals create a learning
zone where students can engage in experiential learning, with facilitated
learning outcomes that promote personal growth and skill development.</p>
