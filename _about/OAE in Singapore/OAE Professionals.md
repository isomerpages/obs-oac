<h3><strong>We are OAE Professionals</strong></h3>
<p>The role of an Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE) professional, particularly
an educator, involves utilising the outdoors as a platform for self-discovery
and social awareness. They play a critical role in the holistic development
of Singaporean youth. Through carefully designed activities, OAE professionals
create a learning zone where students can engage in experiential learning,
with facilitated learning outcomes that promote personal growth and skill
development.</p>
