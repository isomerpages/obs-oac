<p>The NOAE Masterplan was announced during Budget and Committee of Supply
(COS) 2016 to promote holistic development for all youths through an OAE
pathway from primary to post-secondary school level. All primary and secondary
school students are equipped with outdoor living skills, knowledge and
attitude through the Outdoor Education (OE) in Physical Education (PE)
Curriculum introduced in 2014. They are provided with authentic outdoor
environments through 2 to 3 school cohort camps at upper primary and secondary
levels.</p>
<p>On 23 February 2024, MOE announced the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20240223-all-schools-to-benefit-from-increased-capacity-at-new-outdoor-adventure-learning-centres" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consolidation of eight OAE sites to four locations</a>,
which will allow schools to conduct upper primary and lower secondary cohort
camps at these sites. Together, these four locations are projected to fully
meet the camping needs of some 100,000 students participating in cohort
camps and uniformed group programmes each year, from 2032 onwards.</p>
