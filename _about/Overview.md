<h3>Welcome</h3><p>Welcome to the Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE) Resource Website, where we humbly invite you to embark on a journey of discovery and exploration. The site is dedicated to providing you with valuable information about OAE in Singapore and the esteemed OAE Council. We aim to share a treasure trove of resources, including advisories, guidelines, standards, research papers, case studies, and more. With a history dating back to 1967, just two years after Singapore's independence, our rich local knowledge in OE has long been confined to books and notes. But now, we are excited to present an official platform that facilitates the seamless sharing of this wealth of local knowledge. Through this initiative, the OAE Council hopes to continuously inspire the spirit of learning and sharing within the OAE Sector. </p><h3>Long Term Development of the OAE Sector</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/long%20term.png"></div><p>In addition to promoting the adoption of new national standards, the OAE Council will monitor incident rates and adoption rate of national standards, active participation numbers, currency of standards, number of certified OAE providers and non-compliance*. Further measures (regulatory or statutory) if necessary, will be recommended in updates to MCCY.</p><p>*E.g., incident reporting, periodic safety reviews, regular certification assessments, etc.</p>
